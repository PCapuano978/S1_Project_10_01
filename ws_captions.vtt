WEBVTT

NOTE
Our .vtt file is done here, and very differently from the rest of code we've done so far as evident by how this comment must be written. We must start first with a "WEBVTT" to declare what is being read as this code interpreted by the browser, and then the rest is read very specificlly; any amount of whitespace being included.

NOTE
The way this file is written is each caption being three lines long, with the first titiling it as such with "Caption#", then the second line is the timestamp while describing what time it should appear and then cease to do so. Finally, the caption text itself to be placed is then done on the last line.

Caption1
00:01.000 --> 00:004.000 
We observe today 

Caption2
00:04.000 --> 00:06.000 
not a victory of party, 

Caption3
00:06.000 --> 00:10.000 
but a celebration of freedom â€“ 

Caption4
00:10.000 --> 00:12.000 
symbolizing an end, 

Caption5
00:12.000 --> 00:15.000 
as well as a beginning â€“

Caption6
00:15.000 --> 00:17.000 
signifying renewal, 

Caption7
00:17.000 --> 00:19.000 
as well as change. 

Caption8
00:19.000 --> 00:22.000 
For I have sworn before you

Caption9
00:22.000 --> 00:24.000 
and Almighty God 

Caption10
00:24.000 --> 00:27.000 
the same solemn oath

Caption11
00:27.000 --> 00:30.000 
our forebears prescribed 

Caption12
00:30.000 --> 00:33.000 
nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
